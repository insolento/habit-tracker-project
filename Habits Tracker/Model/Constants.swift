Walking through the stages for which a habit is developed in 21 days
obeys the following algorithm:

1. Spend 1 day without contact
to old habits, try to lead
behave as if the goal, conceived
in perspective, at a distance
step.
        
2. Withstand 2 days in the same state
self-control.

3. Mark the first week in your diary
changes and sum up the first results -
what was hard, what was easier,
which is yet to be seriously challenged.

4. Congratulate yourself on passing
first serious threshold at 21 days.
During this time, the rejection of bad
tendencies will already take shape
conscious overcoming and man
will be able to work more
accepting positive traits.

5. Hold the plank for 40 days.
The practitioner already feels
liberated from the past
negativity and moves in the right direction
direction with good dynamics.

6. On the 90th day of compliance with the technique, all
excess from the "past life" ceases
to remind myself, and the person
looking back, realizes himself
completely updated.
